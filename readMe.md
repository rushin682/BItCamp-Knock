# HSS - Health Support System
 
This web application was created as a part of BitCamp Hackathon '17.
A dynamic website which let doctors respond to patients and solve their problems via text during their free time. This project helped us address the basic problem faced by patients like taking appointments and waiting in long queues for minor ailments or just regular checkups.

Developed on PHP backend with the help of AJAX for real-time chat features.
